# 🧠 COVID-19 Twitter Topic Modeling using NMF

This project applies unsupervised learning and topic modeling to analyze over 100,000 English tweets related to COVID-19, using TF-IDF vectorization and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF).

## 🔍 Project Objectives
- Explore semantic themes and latent topics in social media during the early pandemic.
- Apply NMF to discover low-dimensional topic embeddings.
- Visualize tweet clusters in topic space and identify topic-specific keywords.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, NLTK, Matplotlib)
- NMF for topic modeling
- TF-IDF for document-term matrix construction
- 3D scatter plots for tweet visualization
